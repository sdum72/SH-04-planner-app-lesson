# 04-planner-app-lesson

## Overview

This is a simple calendar application (utilizing JQuery, Local Storage, and Day.js) that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. HTML and CSS are dynamically updated according to the time--the background colors of the time blocks are adjusted based upon the classification of the time event (past, present, or future.) The user inputs calendar items into the text area, and clicking the save buttons sets the items into local storage. The added calendar items persist on the page after refresh.

## Usage

This application enables an employee (user) with a busy schedule to add important events so the user can manage the user's time effectively.

## What programs were used to make the planner app.

• An html file provided the content for the application. 
• A css file was provided to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. • I coded the Javascript file to provide dynamic content to the application.
